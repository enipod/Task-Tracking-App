# Simple Task Tracker App

This project is a simple Task tracking app, on which you can add new tasks, add reminders to current tasks, and delete previous tasks.
This small project is made using `Angular` and `TypeScript`.

## Development server

First, run `npm i` to install dependecies.
Second, run `npm run server` to access the mock database that translates to the tasks. 
Third, run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
